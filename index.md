# Ray's Dev Blog

## About Me
I am a self-taught data science/machine learning developer. I learn best from simple examples--if you like to learn that way too, you will enjoy my dev blog! You will find examples in .NET (C# and F#) as well as Python. I appreciate feedback so whether you find something wrong with my code or you benefitted from it, reach out and let me know! :-)

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
